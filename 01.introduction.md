# 1. Introduction 前言

In the early days computers were much simpler. The various components of a system, such as the CPU, memory,mass storage, and network interfaces, were developed together and, as a result, were quite balanced in their performance. For example, the memory and network interfaces were not (much) faster than the CPU at providing data.

早期的计算机简单许多.由于系统中的众多组件,如CPU,内存,大容量内存设备(mass storage),以及网络接口(network interface),是一同被研发出来的,也因此在性能上相当平衡.举例来说,在提供数据时,内存与网络接口并不比CPU 快(非常多).

This situation changed once the basic structure of computers stabilized and hardware developers concentrated on optimizing individual subsystems. Suddenly the performance of some components of the computer fell significantly behind and bottlenecks developed. This was especially true for mass storage and memory subsystems which, for cost reasons, improved more slowly relative to other components.

这个情况随着计算机基础结构的稳定,以及硬件开发者专注于优化独立的子系统而改变了.某些计算机组件的性能突然大幅地落后并成为了瓶颈.尤其是大容量内存设备与内存––由于成本的缘故––相比于其他系统,进步得十分缓慢.

The slowness of mass storage has mostly been dealt with using software techniques: operating systems keep most often used (and most likely to be used) data in main memory, which can be accessed at a rate orders of magnitude faster than the hard disk. Cache storage was added to the storage devices themselves, which requires no changes in the operating system to increase performance. For the purposes of this paper, we will not go into more details of software optimizations for the mass storage access.

大容量内存设备的性能问题主要由软件技术解决:操作系统(operating system)在主存(main memory)––其在存取上比硬盘(hard disk)快了几个数量级––中保存了最常使用(并且最有可能被使用)的数据.缓存亦被加到内存设备中,其不需对操作系统作任何改变就能提升性能.[[1]](#1)由于偏离本文的主旨,我们就不继续深入针对大型内存设备存取的软件优化细节了.

Unlike storage subsystems, removing the main memory as a bottleneck has proven much more difficult and almost all solutions require changes to the hardware. Today these changes mainly come in the following forms:

与内存子系统不同,解决主存的瓶颈已被证实是件更困难的事情,而且几乎所有的解决方法都需要改变硬件.现今这些改变主要有以下这些方式:

* RAM hardware design (speed and parallelism).
* Memory controller designs
* CPU caches
* Direct memory access (DMA) for device.

* RAM 的硬件设计(提升速度以及并行度(*parallelism*)).
* 内存控制器(memory controller)的设计.
* CPU 缓存.
* 直接内存存取(Direct Memory Access,DMA).

For the most part, this document will deal with CPU caches and some effects of memory controller design. In the process of exploring these topics, we will explore DMA and bring it into the larger picture. However, we will start with an overview of the design for today's commodity hardware. This is a prerequisite to understanding the problems and the limitations of efficiently using memory subsystems. We will also learn about, in some detail, the different types of RAM and illustrate why these differences still exist.

本文主要涉及CPU 缓存以及内存控制器设计的一些影响.在探索这些主题的过程中,我们将对DMA 有更深入的理解.不过,我们首先要从概览当今商用硬件的设计开始.这是理解有效使用内存子系统的问题与限制的必要条件.我们也会––稍加详细地––学到不同类型的RAM,并阐述为何这些差异依旧存在.

This document is in no way all inclusive and final. It is limited to commodity hardware and further limited to a subset of that hardware. Also, many topics will be discussed in just enough detail for the goals of this paper. For such topics, readers are recommended to find more detailed documentation.

本文绝非最终且完整的.本文仅止于商用硬件,而且仅限这类硬件的一个子集.同时,许多主题的讨论仅点到为止,以能达到本文目的为主.对于这些主题,建议读者去寻找更详尽的文档.

When it comes to operating-system-specific details and solutions, the text exclusively describes Linux. At no time will it contain any information about other OSes. The author has no interest in discussing the implications for other OSes. If the reader thinks s/he has to use a different OS they have to go to their vendors and demand they write documents similar to this one.

当提及特定操作系统的细节与解决方案时,本文仅特指Linux.无论何时都不会涵盖其他OS 的任何信息.作者无意着墨于其它的OS.假如读者认为他／她必须使用不同的OS,那么他／她得去寻求供应商撰写与本文相似的文档.

One last comment before the start. The text contains a number of occurrences of the term "usually” and other, similar qualifiers. The technology discussed here exists in many, many variations in the real world and this paper only addresses the most common, mainstream versions. It is rare that absolute statements can be made about this technology, thus the qualifiers.

开始前的最后一点说明.本文包含许多"通常"以及其他类似的修饰语.在这里讨论的技术在现实世界中存在着非常非常多不同的变种,而本文仅针对最常见,最主流的版本.这些技术很少能下定论,故特此说明.

## 文档结构

This document is mostly for software developers. It does not go into enough technical details of the hardware to be useful for hardware-oriented readers. But before we can go into the practical information for developers a lot of groundwork must be laid.

本文主要写给软件开发者,不会深入探讨对硬件导向的读者有用的硬件技术细节.但在我们能够讨论对开发者实用的信息前,有许多基础得打.

To that end, the second section describes random-access memory (RAM) in technical detail. This section's content is nice to know but not absolutely critical to be able to understand the later sections. Appropriate back references to the section are added in places where the content is required so that the anxious reader could skip most of this section at first.

为了达到这个目标,第二节面向技术细节探讨随机存取内存(Random-Access Memory,RAM).这一节的内容值得一读,但对于理解后面几节并非必要.在需要此节内容之处都会加上合适的引用(*back references*),所以心急的读者可以先略过本节的大部分内容.

The third section goes into a lot of details of CPU cache behavior. Graphs have been used to keep the text from being as dry as it would otherwise be. This content is essential for an understanding of the rest of the document. Section 4 describes briefly how virtual memory is implemented. This is also required groundwork for the rest.

第三节描述了许多CPU 缓存(*CPU cache*)行为的细节.本节会用上一些图表以避免文字变得枯燥乏味.本节内容是理解本文后续章节所不可或缺的.第四节简述了虚拟内存(virtual memory)如何实现.这也是其余部份的必要基础.

Section 5 goes into a lot of detail about Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) systems.

第五节描述了非统一内存访问(Non-Uniform Memory Access,NUMA)架构的诸多细节.

Section 6 is the central section of this paper. It brings together all the previous sections' information and gives programmers advice on how to write code which performs well in the various situations. The very impatient reader could start with this section and, if necessary, go back to the earlier sections to freshen up the knowledge of the underlying technology.

第六节是本文的核心章节.其将先前几节的信息总结在一起,并给予程序员一些建议:如何能在不同情境中撰写良好运作的程序.非常不耐烦的读者可以从此节开始,同时,在必要时,回到先前的章节回顾基础技术的知识.

Section 7 introduces tools which can help the programmer do a better job. Even with a complete understanding of the technology it is far from obvious where in a non-trivial software project the problems are. Some tools are necessary.

第七节介绍了一些能够帮助程序员做得更好的工具.即使完全理解了这些技术,距离明确复杂软件工程的问题仍十分遥远.某些工具是必要的.

In section 8 we finally give an outlook of technology which can be expected in the near future or which might just simply be good to have.

在第八节,将展望可以在未来几年期待,或是希望拥有的技术.

## 致谢

I would like to thank Johnray Fuller and especially Jonathan Corbet for taking on part of the daunting task of transforming the author's form of English into something more traditional. Markus Armbruster provided a lot of valuable input on problems and omissions in the text.

## 关于本文

The title of this paper is an homage to David Goldberg's classic paper "What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic" [goldberg]. Goldberg's paper is still not widely known, although it should be a prerequisite for anybody daring to touch a keyboard for serious programming.

## 注释

Changes are needed, however, to guarantee data integrity when using storage device caches.

然而,为了保证使用内存设备缓存时的数据完整性(data integrity),改变是必要的.
